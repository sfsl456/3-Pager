	<h3>Something Cool About Me</h3>
	<p>Something cool about me is I have a twin brother, also I dog that I rescued name Meuni. Meuni is a dashscunhd she's super long and is really fast.Meuni is a girl, shes is only two years old. My classes are advanced web and entrepuernial media.I jioned those classes because I'd sort of liked web development last year. In my house there are two dogs. I dont watch basketball or any sports for that matter. My brother has a Disney+ account an he loves Kim Possible.
<p>My favorite movie is The Greatest Showman but its only because I like the music a lot. My favorite food out of the seafood category is shrimp and crab, but my favorite out of the sweets category is donuts. I dont know why I like donuts some much probably because there is such a wide variety of them. Also I like shrimp because you can do so much with it. I really like crab because I like cracking the shells.</p>
